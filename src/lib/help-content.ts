The CRM automatically categorizes fans into tiers based on their spending behavior.

## Tier Definitions

### üêã Whale ($5,000+)
Your top spenders. These fans contribute the most revenue and deserve special attention.

### üíé High Tier ($1,000 - $4,999)
Consistent high-value fans who regularly purchase content and send tips.

### üí∞ Medium Tier ($250 - $999)
Regular subscribers who occasionally purchase PPV or send tips.

### üíµ Low Tier ($0 - $249)
New or occasional fans. Great potential for growth.

## How Tiers Are Calculated

Fan tiers are based on **total lifetime spending**, including:
- Subscription fees
- Tips
- PPV purchases
- Message purchases

Tiers update automatically as fans spend more.

## Using Tier Information

- Focus high-touch service on whales
- Create targeted campaigns for each tier
- Track tier migration over time
- Set notification thresholds by tier`,
