## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Version Control ✅
```bash
# Already complete - repository is clean
git status
# On branch main
# nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

### Step 2: Build Test
```bash
# Test that the build works
npm run build
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages
✓ Finalizing page optimization
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

**Option A: GitHub Integration (Recommended)**
1. Repository already pushed to GitHub ✅
2. Go to https://vercel.com/new
3. Import: `DataSyncDynamics/onlyfans-crm`
4. Framework: Next.js (auto-detected)
5. Add environment variables (see below)
6. Click "Deploy"

**Option B: Vercel CLI**
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Step 4: Environment Variables

Add these in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:

```bash
# AI Configuration
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
AI_AUTO_SEND_THRESHOLD=50
AI_MIN_CONFIDENCE=0.7
AI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
AI_MAX_TOKENS=500
AI_CONTENT_FILTER_ENABLED=true
AI_REQUIRE_APPROVAL_FOR_NEW_FANS=true
AI_REQUIRE_APPROVAL_FOR_ALL=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AI_CHAT=true
```

⚠️ **Important:** Do NOT add Supabase variables yet - system works with mock data
